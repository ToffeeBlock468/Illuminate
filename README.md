# Illuminate
## Overview
Illuminate is an operating system designed for the x86-64 platform and it is currently being developed by me solely. My goals with this operating system are simple; It is to be easy to operate for average users, but complex enough for developers to freely design around, and it should be able to execute non-native applications, so that the support for applications is much wider and Illuminate exclusive versions of software do not have to be created. It also should have an aesthetically pleasing design and user interface, but not be overcomplicated or irritating to navigate through, and also have a wide support for drivers and hardware.
## Is this Open or Closed Source?
At this current time, Illuminate will be staying as a closed source operating system. But this might change in future, as I'm not entirely sure how far I'll get through a project of this size.

## When Will a Release Version be Available?
When it comes to a release, alpha or even beta version of this operating system, I'm not entirely sure when any will be available. This is a passion project of mine and I work on it in my free time, and with a project of this calibur it naturally takes a long time to get everything in order, debugged and working as intended. There will however be updates on this repository, more specifically on this readme.
